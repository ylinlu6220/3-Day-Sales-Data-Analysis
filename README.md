Synopsis:
Created an interactive dashboard using Google Cloud, Looker Studio, and MySQL Workbench using hand inputed data from an excel sheet.
This was a great project to work on to learn MySQL for the first time and be able to use code to visualize results.

Points to Remember:
When looking at the waitress data, please know that waitress ID 1 is used for orders/tables that are shared between multiple waitresses. Which only occurs when there are parties greater than 10.
Waitress ID 9 is used for to-go orders, therefore tips and order total averages are much lower compared to the other waitresses.

Conclusions:
From the results of the data, we can see that the buffet generates more revenue from the Dinner menu than the Lunch menu.
However, this can be due to various reasons, such as there are more Dinner customers than Lunch customers due to the fact that Dinner hours are open for longer.
In addition, the data showed that the average order total greatly increases when there are children in the party. This can mean that the Buffet should set their target demographic as families.
